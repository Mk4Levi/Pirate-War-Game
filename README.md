# Pirate War Game

## => This is Pirate War Game where 2 pirates battle with each other through their cards by rolling the Dice.

## => I have made this by using Vanilla JS only. For building this game I've used concepts like Import/Export, Object-Destructuring, Ternary Operator, Constructor Methods in Classes, Arrow Functions, etc.
